            <p>Welcome to my corner of Ann Arbor! I'm Yujia, and it's been eight months since I arrived here, embarking on my first journey studying abroad and navigating life on my own. Ann Arbor embraced me with open arms, and I'm immensely grateful for every moment spent in this vibrant city. To keep these cherished memories last, this site captures experiences I've encountered hereâ€” from discovering delectable eateries to engaging in enriching activities that deepen my understanding of the U.S., not to mention the amazing MOLI dancing club I participated in! This website will undoubtedly evolve over time as my journey unfolds. Nonetheless, reminiscing about these joyful moments transports me back to the scenes of those experiences, evoking an indescribable sense of joy. I hope you'll join me in relishing these memories!</p>

                    <p>Searching for tasty food is my go-to stress reliever during study sessions. Yet, my exploration of Ann Arbor's culinary scene barely scratches the surface, with only 1% of its total restaurants discovered so far. Here, I'll share a handful of dining spots that have truly impressed me, ones I'll undoubtedly revisit time and time again. If any of these are unfamiliar to you, rest assured, each one is well worth a taste!</p>

                    <p>MOLI holds a special place in my heart - it's the one and only school club I've joined since my arrival. MOLI is a Chinese dancing troupe with a diverse repertoire spanning Chinese dance, K-pop, jazz, and choreography. This section summarizes the unforgettable performances, big and small, that I have shared with my fellow MOLI members. Oh, I really love this big family. :)</p>

                    <p>Besides focusing on my studies, I've made a concerted effort to engage in a variety of activities, many of which are organized by the International Student Center, to expand my social circle and meet new friendships. It's not only an excellent opportunity to enhance my English proficiency but also to deepen my understanding of American culture.</p>
