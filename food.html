                        <h2>Kang's Korean Restaurant</h2>
                        <p>This is a classic homestyle Korean restaurant. I especially love the spicy stir-fried series; the spicy pork, spicy chicken, spicy squid, are all very good. My roommate likes the Beef Soup best. It tastes really fresh.</p>

                        <h2>Jerusalem Garden</h2>
                        <p>To be honest, I hadn't explored much Lebanese cuisine before, but this restaurant truly impressed me! The dish in the left picture features rice paired with a blend of minced beef and lamb, boasting a unique texture. I've also heard rave reviews about their sandwiches, so if you're a Mediterranean food enthusiast, this spot is definitely worth checking out!.</p>

                        <h2>Hola Seoul</h2>
                        <p>Absolutely! I'm a huge fan of Korean cuisine. The fact that the owner of this store is Korean adds to its authenticity. Their fried chicken is a must-try; even when we ordered a small size, it turned out to be a big portion. And, don't you find the colors of their lunch combos so vibrant and appetizing?</p>

                        <h2>Frita Batidos</h2>
                        <p>This is hands down one of my top go-to spots for outings with family and friends. With its spacious seating area, accommodating a large group is never a concern. I absolutely love the ingenious touch of placing the fries right in the middle of the burger—it's brilliant! Plus, they have card games (I think maybe it's the correct way to call those) available on every table, so we can easily pass the time while waiting for our delicious meals to arrive.</p>

                        <h2>Jamaican Jerk Pit</h2>
                        <p>One day, while walking from CCTC to NQ, I stumbled upon this charming little gem. Tucked away in a small storefront with the main restaurant located in the basement, it might be a bit tricky to find at your first visit. However, every time I stroll down that street, I'm greeted by the irresistible aroma wafting from this spot. The decor exudes a nostalgic charm that I find quite endearing. Pictured on the left is the Beef Burrito, a dish I absolutely adore.</p>

                        <h2>Slurping Turtle</h2>
                        <p>This store serves great Ramen, but it also offers a variety of Japanese appetizers and sushi. I can't seem to get enough of this place! From my experience, it's a bustling hub where people gather to eat, chat, and unwind over drinks; it's always buzzing with activity. To secure a spot, it's wise to arrive early or make a reservation. Personally, their duck-oil fried chicken is my favorite. And, according to my Japanese friends, this place is as authentic as it gets.</p>

                        <h2>Saica</h2>
                        <p>This Japanese spot is conveniently located near my place, making it the perfect go-to for those lazy nights when nobody feels like cooking. I highly recommend trying their Red Curry Ramen and Beef Ramen—they're simply delicious. What sets this place apart for me is the incredibly friendly owners. I remember a time when I forgot my wallet, and I Apple Pay was dead; when I asked if I could quickly run home and return, they agreed without any hesitation.</p>

                        <h2>Milk & Froth Ice Cream</h2>
                        <p>One of my friends recommended this place to me, and I instantly fell in love with it. They offer a variety of flavors, and I don't think any of them would disappoint. Personally, I'm obsessed with the Black Sesame flavor—it's truly one-of-a-kind, and I doubt you'll find anything quite like it at other stores</p>

                        <h2>Mochinut</h2>
                        <p>This adorable little store near my place always catches my eye as I pass by—it seems there's always a line of people waiting to get their hands on some treats. However, the wait is never too long because they always have plenty of donuts pre-prepared. They offer a wide range of flavors, from classic originals to indulgent chocolate, creamy, fruity options like strawberry and pineapple, and even unique choices like matcha. I've heard that donuts are a favorite among many Americans, and I can see why—they're absolutely delicious!</p>
