            <h2>English Language Institute</h2>
            <p class="intro">This picture was taken on October 31, 2023, at Burns Park. I had only been in the US for about a month at that time and was fascinated by everything around me. As you can probably tell from the tablecloth, we were celebrating the Autumn. I learned that here, people celebrate by eating donuts and drinking apple cider. We also played a game called "Jenga", which involves taking turns to remove pieces from a stack without causing it to collapse. It was a wonderful memory!</p>

            <h2>English Circle</h2>
            <p class="intro">I joined the English Circle during my first semester here, feeling quite uncertain about my English skills and lacking confidence in conversing with others. However, when I discovered this opportunity tailored for international students, I didn't hesitate to join. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made: I met a Japanese girl with whom I still keep in touch and hang out from time to time!</p>

            <h2>International Student Center</h2>
            <p class="intro">As you can see from the picture, it's an activity session hosted by the International Center on Saint Patrick's Day! We were busy decorating clover-shaped cookies with green and silver icing. During the event, I had the pleasure of meeting an Iranian girl named Asal, who is pursuing her graduate degree in dentistry here. Participating in these events has helped me become more outgoing, and I'm now more willing to initiate conversations with people I meet for the first time. It's rewarding to see myself undergo these positive changes.</p>

            <div class="descriptions" id="d4">
            <h2>The Snow!</h2>
            <p class="intro">In Michigan, snow is more than just weather—it's an experience, especially for a girl like me who grew up in the southern part of China, where snow is a rare occurrence even in the coldest winters. Despite occasional power outages, snow feels like a blessing, and it never fails to lift my spirits when I watch snowflakes gracefully falling from the sky, blanketing the ground in white. This alley, which I traverse every day from the bus station to my apartment, transforms into a scene straight out of a fairy tale during snowy weather.</p>
