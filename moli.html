        <h2>Prosperous</h2>
        <div class="group">
        <p class="intro">This performance took place on a Wednesday evening, April 3rd, during the Celebration of Culture event at the Michigan Theatre, one of the most prestigious venues on the Ann Arbor Central Campus. The event showcased a diverse array of cultural performances, including Indian dances, K-pop routines, African dances, and Korean drumming, highlighting the inclusive atmosphere of the University of Michigan. In line with the event's theme, our group chose to present a traditional Chinese dance, characterized by flowing movements and vibrant red costumes. This dance seamlessly blends strength and flexibility, featuring dynamic sequences of powerful movements interspersed with graceful extensions to complement the music. For our group, this performance marked the culmination of the semester's on-stage activities, and for some members who are graduating soon, it held special sentimental value as their final performance with MOLI.</p>

        <h2>The Morning Ritual</h2>
        <div class="group">
        <p class="intro">This piece was performed at both our own showcase and the Chinese New Year Festival event hosted by CSSA. It involved a large group of approximately 15 members, all of whom had been practicing and rehearsing diligently since the beginning of last semester. The results showcased on stage were the culmination of four months of dedicated practice. As depicted in the pictures below, our costumes consisted of Qipao, traditional attire from the 1900s that elegantly accentuates the curves of women in an implicit manner. Achieving synchronicity and precision in group dances is crucial, and our performance was no exception. The addition of small stools added technical complexity, requiring us to maintain balance while executing intricate movements, including standing on them and lifting our legs. Personally, I have a deep affection for this dance; it resonates with my gentle and soft personality and affinity for melodious music.</p>

        <h2>Dunhuang</h2>
        <div class="group">
        <p class="intro">This traditional dance, performed at both our showcase and the Spring Festival Event, serves as a vibrant embodiment of the rich heritage and artistic expression of the Silk Road civilizations. Characterized by graceful movements, vibrant costumes, and intricate choreography, it showcases MOLI's commitment to sharing China's beautiful and extensive history with the world. Initiated by one of my friends as a smaller dancing project, we dedicated ourselves to practicing three times a week for four weeks. Sometimes, the late-night rehearsals required me to catch the 12:30 am Blue Bus home. Despite the fatigue, these late-night practices hold fond memories for me, culminating in a successful performance on stage.</p>

        <h2>Fearless</h2>
        <div class="group">
        <p class="intro">This is a famous short dance that went viral on Chinese social media some time ago. The direct translation of the name of this dance from Chinese is "Huo Yuanjia," named after a renowned general from an ancient dynasty known for protecting family and ethical values. This performance marked my debut on stage after joining MOLI. It took place at the ROSS auditorium during a sorority party celebration.</p>

        <h2>Backstage Moments</h2>
        <p class="intro">I enjoy spending time with the girls backstage. Most of the time, preparing for a performance requires us to arrive early, sometimes up to four hours in advance and sometimes it can take up the entire day. During this time, we engage in final rehearsals and preparations. As a result, we have plenty of downtime backstage, where we chat, take pictures to capture the moments, and even work on finishing up assignments if it's accidentally to be a busy academic week. It's in these moments that I've made some wonderful friendships. It's always comforting to be surrounded by people who care about you and with whom you can share thoughts and experiences in daily life.</p>
